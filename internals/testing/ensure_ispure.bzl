"""
    This module exposes a single rule, 'test_pure_tagged_correctly'.

    Within Google, a 'pure()' function is used as a hack to mark functions
    as side-effect free: http://cs/file:pure.ts%20function:pure

    Outside of Google, this function is a no-op, but instead the convention
    is to use /* #__PURE__ */ as a prefix to pure function calls.

    test_pure_tagged_correctly takes a list of srcs, and it na√Øvely
    checks to see if every function call to 'pure(' is prefixed with that
    annotation on the same line.
